    Two teams compete by each having a "grandmaster" give one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the board. The other players on the team attempt to guess their team's words or "spies" while avoiding the words of the other team. One grandmaster gives clues to the other player or players on their team. The first team to recognize all of their words will win. Have fun!

## Alias Online Board Game ##

Target audience - Game night hosters & Children 6 & up

This product is for close knit groups who are looking for a fun time. Testing your vocabulary and word association, Alias is a perfect game that you and the entire ensemble can enjoy. You split up into teams and assign one person on each team to be the "Grandmaster" who will dictate the fate of each team by giving one word hints to their table correlating to words on the board. Team members who are not the "Grandmaster", will engage in trying to pick out which words their grandmaster is attempting to hint to them. The game ends when one team finds all of their words or a member of the team chooses the automatic loss spot.

This product will solve the times where you have a group of people that would like to engage in a fun activity, but you aren't sure what you should do.

The game Alias is an interactive fun game that incorporates team work and word correlation to enjoy a fun and competitive time.
